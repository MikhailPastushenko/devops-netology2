## Домашнее задание к занятию "7.3." ##

###  ###
1. Выполните terraform init
   2_1
2. Создайте два воркспейса stage и prod
   2_2
3. В уже созданный aws_instance добавьте зависимость типа инстанса от вокспейса, что бы в разных ворскспейсах использовались разные instance_type
4. Добавим count. Для stage должен создаться один экземпляр ec2, а для prod два.
